221(g) 类型
There are, in essence, two types of 221(g) cases: ![reference](https://visarefusal.com/221g/)

* Washington-related “administrative processing”, in which a clearance or approval is required from an interested agency or agencies in Washington, D.C.
* Post-related, in which the consular officer requires additional time, information, or documentation before making a final visa decision.

221(g) 按具体颜色的含义: ![reference](http://www.h1bwiki.com/221g-administrative-processing/)

* Blue Slip: A 221g Blue slip is given when the additional documentation is required. After submitting the required documents, a decision will be taken by the Consulate.
* Pink Slip: A 221g Pink slip is handed out when your application needs further administrative processing. The consulate will notify you once the processing is done. This form is most likely issued when the Visa Officer is doubtful about your current employer or work related information. You will be given a reference id and you can track the status online.
* Yellow Slip: A 221 g Yellow slip denotes general type of administrative processing. The Consulate looks at all the documentation provided by the candidate and the employer.
* White Slip: A 221g White slip denotes requirement for further processing by the USCIS. The Consulate pushes back these kinds of cases to the USCIS and the decision is taken based on the information obtained from the USCIS.

To confirm that an SAO is in process, ISS advisers can contact the Public Inquiries Division at DOS. To contact the Public Inquiries Division, you can call 202.663.1225, or, if seeking clarification on F, M, or J visas, e-mail the Student/Exchange Visitor Visa Center at fmjvisas[at]state.gov. While DOS recommends that you wait at least 90 days from the interview date before inquiring about a case, you can check the status of a case at any time. Generally, when you contact Public Inquiries you will be told that the application has been received and is undergoing additional administrative review, and that the consulate will contact the applicant once this review has been completed.
